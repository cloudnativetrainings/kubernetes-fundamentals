# Kubernetes Fundamentals

## Setup training environment

This repository is designed to work with GitHub Codespaces (hence devcontaners).

Please run the `pre-checks.sh` script to make sure that all required components are running:

```bash
./pre-checks.sh
```

Start the codespaces on the repo, wait until the setup is ready, and start with the [01_hello-k8s](./01_hello-k8s/README.md) lab.
